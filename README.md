Crawling was performed by final-year students for their final assignment dataset, which created a NER model. Key words used in the crawling process included: Gibran, Indonesia, nadiem, bandung, magelang, pssi, ruangguru, gopay, telkomsel, ambon, bali, bunga, kementerian, Tokopedia, depok, bogor, Jokowi, indihome, dana, bca, anya, server, and so on. There are 62 keywords in total. 
Each sentence in the dataset ends with a period, followed by a blank line, then a new sentence begins. Column 1 contains the words, and column 2 contains the labels.

There are still many inconsistencies in the labeling. Label: Person, Location, Organization
